This bot provides a live feed into a discord channel of all the games being played in SaveMGO2/Metal Gear Online 2 (the online component to MGS4). It is a work in progress as a result it currently does not have error handling.

# Setting up the Discord Bot

Copy the .py files and run the bot in your chosen code editor or server host. Copy your bots token from the Discord developer portal, guild name, and channel ID of where you want the lobby data to be posted. Paste the relevant information where I have placed prompts in the code for them.

As per the below our Discord guild uses custom emojis. You can delete all of information in the double quotes or replace with external emojis to get the same look below. All emojis can be found on the official savemgo discord server.
